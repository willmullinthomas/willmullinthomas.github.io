                    Inspired by my brother and his roomates quizzing each other on their multiplication tables, I created a desktop app that allows anyone to test their knowledge and speed. Unit tests will run as a part of a github workflow every time a new commit is pushed.

                    A portfolio website I created with the help of <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Create React App</a> for the initial build configuration. All components and styling were created by me with the exception of the icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Font Awesome</a>. The website is hosted right from the repo with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub pages</a>.
